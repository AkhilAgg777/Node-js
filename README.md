Node js

A Few things about this app:-

1.) This app is created without using database so contacts added will be store in RAM.Therefore,these contacts will be there till the server is running.On killing server,contacts added from front-end will disappear as they were store in RAM


2.) This app is quite basic.In this you can add contact and you can delete contact as well.
